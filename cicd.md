# CI/CD Implementation Plan for Baby Weight Prediction App

This document outlines the phased approach for implementing a production-ready CI/CD pipeline for the Baby Weight Prediction application using Terraform, Cloud Build, and Cloud Run on Google Cloud Platform.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

### 1.1 Set up Terraform Project Structure
- Create a `terraform` directory in the project root
- Initialize Terraform project structure
- Create provider configuration for GCP
- Set up backend configuration for state management

### 1.2 Define GCP Resources
- Define Cloud Run service resources
- Configure Cloud Build triggers
- Set up IAM permissions and service accounts
- Define networking and security resources
- Configure Vertex AI endpoints access

### 1.3 State Management
- Create a GCS bucket for Terraform state
- Configure remote state backend
- Set up state locking mechanism
- Document state management approach

### 1.4 Test Infrastructure Deployment
- Test Terraform plan locally
- Validate resource configurations
- Implement initial deployment
- Document infrastructure deployment process

## Phase 2: Containerization

### 2.1 Create Dockerfile
- Create a Dockerfile for the Streamlit application
- Configure proper base image with Python dependencies
- Set up environment variables
- Optimize container size and security

### 2.2 Local Container Testing
- Build container image locally
- Test container functionality
- Validate environment configurations
- Document container build process

### 2.3 Container Registry Setup
- Set up Google Artifact Registry repository
- Configure authentication and permissions
- Test pushing and pulling images
- Document registry access procedures

## Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline with Cloud Build

### 3.1 Cloud Build Configuration
- Create `cloudbuild.yaml` configuration file
- Define build steps (test, build, deploy)
- Configure artifact storage
- Set up build notifications

### 3.2 Build Triggers
- Configure GitHub repository integration
- Set up branch-based triggers (main, development)
- Configure manual approval steps for production
- Document trigger configurations

### 3.3 Automated Testing
- Implement unit tests in the pipeline
- Set up integration tests
- Configure test reporting
- Implement quality gates

### 3.4 Deployment Steps
- Configure Cloud Run deployment steps
- Implement progressive deployment strategy
- Set up rollback mechanisms
- Document deployment procedures

## Phase 4: Production Deployment

### 4.1 Cloud Run Configuration
- Configure Cloud Run service settings
- Set up autoscaling parameters
- Configure memory and CPU allocation
- Implement request timeout settings

### 4.2 Domain and SSL
- Configure custom domain for the application
- Set up SSL certificates
- Implement domain mapping
- Configure security headers

### 4.3 Monitoring and Logging
- Set up Cloud Monitoring for the application
- Configure custom metrics for ML model performance
- Implement logging strategy
- Create monitoring dashboards and alerts

### 4.4 Production IAM and Security
- Configure least-privilege IAM roles
- Set up service accounts for production
- Implement secrets management
- Document security practices
